It is a straightforward to-do app developed with javascript, CSS, and HTML. Using which a user may add everyday chores. Users can add new items to lists in the to-do web app, and lists that have items added to them are displayed. Additionally, a user can designate a task as "complete" once it has been successfully done, and these tasks then show up on a different list called done Tasks. Additionally, it can include a new section called Pending jobs that would detail all the jobs that need to be finished. In this scenario, the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list will be combined to create the to-do list. The user has the ability to remove tasks from any list.
